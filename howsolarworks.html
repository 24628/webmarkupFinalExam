                    A solar charger gathers energy from your solar panels, and stores it in your batteries.
                    Using the latest, fastest technology, SmartSolar maximises this energy-harvest, driving
                    it intelligently to achieve full charge in the shortest possible time. SmartSolar
                    maintains battery health, extending its life.

                    The SmartSolar charge controller will even recharge a severely depleted battery. It can
                    operate with a battery voltage as low as 0 Volts, provided the cells are not permanently
                    sulphated or otherwise damaged.

                    Established product features and integrated software solutions will provide yield
                    optimization throughout the systemâ€™s entire service life. Even in shading. SMA ShadeFix
                    is a proprietary inverter software that optimizes energy yield in nearly every situation.
                    SMA Smart Connected inverter monitoring offers enhanced safety by detecting errors at
                    an early stage and automatically reporting them to the installer.
